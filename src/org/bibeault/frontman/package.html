      <p>
        The purpose of <b>Front Man</b> is to provide an ultra-lightweight web framework that adheres to the principle that
        the answer to the question "How big should a web framework be?" is "Barely enough". It aims to provide the basic
        plumbing for Model 2-patterned web applications while achieving the project goals of:
        <ul>
          <li>The API and usage is learnable within an hour.</li>
          <li>Can be set up in minutes.</li>
          <li>Reasonably self-contained; does not require a bunch of 3rd-party jar files in order to operate. The only dependency is to the Jakarta Commons Logging (which can be easily removed, if desired).</li>
          <li>A tiny set of easily-understandable public classes and interfaces.</li>
          <li>Servlet controllers and page views are referenced via abstracted naming (no Invoker-like class names in URLs, and no hard-coded file paths for JSP files).</li>
          <li>Minimal configuration within web.xml.</li>
          <li>Zero to minimal mapping configuration: your choice of "configuration by convention", Java annotations, or of more explicit control via simple properties files.</li>
          <li>Minimal processing overhead per request.</li>
          <li>No hiding or getting in the way of how the servlet API works.</li>
          <li>Generally usable, but designed with Model 2 applications using scriptless JSP 2 pages in mind.</li>
          <li>No required on-page impact: no required declarations, directives or tags.</li>
          <li>No unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        Overview of set up steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Drop the Front Man jar file into your application's <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> folder.</li>
          <li>Grab the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/" target="_blank">Jakarta Commons Logging</a> jar file and drop it into <code>WEB-INF/lib</code>.</li>
          <li>Add the <tt>&lt;servlet&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</tt> entries for the Command Broker servlet in the deployment descriptor (<code>web.xml</code>).</li>
          <li>Optionally, create properties files to define explicit mappings for the command verbs and view names respectively.</li>
          <li>Start writing your pages and commands!</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Let's take a look at each of these steps in detail.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <a name="SECTION_2_1"><h2>2.1 Add the Jar Files to the Applications</h2></a>

        <p>
          Once you have obtained the <code>frontman-1.6.1.jar</code> file, just drop it into your web application's
          <code>WEB-INF/lib</code> folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          The only other jar file necessary jar is Jakarta Commons Logging. This allows the logging performed
          by Front Man to hook into either
          <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html" target="_blank">Log4J</a> or the
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html" target="_blank">java.util.logging package</a>
          as defined by your web app. Obtain this jar from
          <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">the Jakarta Project site</a>.

        <p>
          The Front Man front controller, the <code>CommandBroker</code> class, must be established as a servlet in the
          deployment descriptor, and mapped to an appropriate URL pattern. Initialization parameters specify how
          command verbs are mapped to their corresponding command classes, and how view names are mapped to the path
          of their view resources. These initialization parameters are defined as:
          <table class="inline" cellspacing="1">
            <tr>
              <th>Init Param Name</th>
              <th>Description</th>

            <tr>
              <td><tt>commandsPath</tt></td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  Defines the root path at which to automatically search for command classes with
                  the <tt>@FrontmanCommand()</tt> annotation, or when employing implicit command mapping
                  by convention (command mapping is explained in detail in
                  <a href="#SECTION_3_1">Section 3.1</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This parameter can be omitted only if a <tt>commandVerbsProperties</tt> parameter is specified.
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><tt>viewsPath</tt></td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  Defines the root path at which to search for view resources relative to the context root.
                  The full path for the resource is created by appending a slash followed by the view name,
                  followed by the string ".jsp".
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if the <tt>viewsPath</tt> is defined as <tt>/WEB-INF/pages</tt>, a view name of
                  <tt>something</tt> would be mapped to a path of <tt>/WEB-INF/pages/something.jsp</tt>, while
                  a view name of <tt>xyz/hello</tt> would map to <tt>/WEB-INF/pages/xyz/hello.jsp</tt>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that this implicit mapping is attempted only if no explicit mapping for the views names is
                  found in a properties bundle defined by <tt>viewNamesproperties</tt>.
                </p>
                <p>This parameter is optional.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><tt>commandVerbsProperties</tt></td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  Defines the context-relative location of a properties file that contains explicit
                  command verb to Command class name mappings.
                </p>
                <p>This parameter is optional if a <tt>commandsPath</tt> parameter is provided.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><tt>viewNamesProperties</tt></td>
              <td>
                <p>
                  Defines the context-relative location of a properties file that contains
                  explicit view name to view resource path mappings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This parameter is optional. Note that if neither of a <tt>viewNamesProperties</tt>
                  or <tt>viewsPath</tt> parameter is specified, view names cannot be used and all
                  views need to be referenced by explicit URL. It is highly recommended to use view
                  names.
                </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical such declaration might look like:
          <pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;CommandBroker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.bibeault.frontman.CommandBroker&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;commandsPath&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;com.mydomain.projectname.commands&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;viewsPath&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/pages&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>Another possibility:
          <pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;CommandBroker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.bibeault.frontman.CommandBroker&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;commandVerbsProperties&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/command.verbs.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;viewNamesProperties&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/view.names.properties&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The optional <b><code>commandVerbsProperties</code></b> and <b><code>viewNamesProperties</code></b> init
          parameters can be used to specify the path where the mapping property files can be found. These path
          values must begin with "/" and are referenced relative to the context root.
        </p>

        <p>
          The servlet mapping for this controller is typically along the lines of:
          <pre>
&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;CommandBroker&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/command/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
          </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>command</code> prefix to this mapping can be any word you would like,
          but the pattern for the mapping must be as shown. Use of the conventional prefix
          <code>command</code> is highly recommended unless it would cause a conflict with a URL
          pattern that you are not at liberty to change.
        </p>

        <p>
          This mapping establishes URLs to the various commands you will define as:
          <pre>
  http://yourserver.com/contextPath/command/commandVerb
          </pre>
          where:
          <ul>
            <li><code>yourserver.com</code> is the domain name for your server.</li>
            <li><code>contextPath</code> is the context path established for your application.</li>
            <li><code>commandVerb</code> is the verb for a command.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, let's say that you have defined a command verb such as <code>doSomethingWonderful</code>
          in your properties file, the URL to execute that command would be:
          <pre>
  http://yourserver.com/contextPath/command/doSomethingWonderful
          </pre>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <a name="SECTION_2_3"><h2>2.3 Set Up Optional Mapping Properties Files</h2></a>

        <p>
          The optional configuration files that map command class names to their verbs, and view
          names to their resource URLs, are refreshingly simple. They are merely run-of-the-mill
          Java properties files.
        </p>

        <div class="section">
          <a name="SECTION_2_3_1"><h3>2.3.1 The Command Verbs Properties File</h3></a>

          <p>
            The Command Verbs Properties File is used to explicitly associate command verbs with the
            command classes that should be executed when that verb is used in a URL to the Front Man
            command broker servlet. This file is identified to the system via the optional
            <code>commandVerbsProperties</code> init parameter to that servlet.
          </p>

          <p>
            The properties defined in this file map command verbs to the names of the classes, each
            implementing the {@link org.bibeault.frontman.Command} interface, that will be invoked
            when that verb is specified in a URL. A typical entry might look like:
            <pre>
  doSomethingWonderful=com.whatever.someproject.commands.DoSomethingWonderfulCommand</pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            A useful convention is for command verbs to start with a lowercase character, and a verb
            that describes the action to be taken by the command.
          </p>

          <p>
            See <a href="#SECTION_3_1">Section 3.1</a> for details on how commands verbs
            are mapped to their respective Command classes.

        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <a name="SECTION_2_3_2"><h3>2.3.2 The View Names Properties File</h3></a>

          <p>
            The View Names Properties File is used to associate view names with the context-relative URLs that locate the resource
            (usually a JSP or HTML file) invoked when the view name is referenced. This file is identified to the system via
            the <code>viewNamesProperties</code> init parameter to the command broker servlet.
          </p>

          <p>
            View names are most often referenced from within commands as the target of a forward or redirect operation. By
            abstracting the view names from their physical location, changes in the view resource hierarchy will not require
            any changes to the code as physical URLs are not used to reference the resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            Within the properties file, each entry associates a view name with the location of the named resource. Some typical
            entries in this properties file could be:
            <pre>
  ErrorPage=/errors.jsp
  HomePage=/WEB-INF/pages/home.jsp
  LoginPage=/WEB-INF/pages/login.jsp
  ProfileEntryForm=/WEB-INF/pages/profile.entry.jsp
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            As with command verbs, a recommended convention has been established that seems to help keep things tidy:
            <ul>
              <li>View names should start with an uppercase character and be a grammatical noun; typically a compound noun that
              uniquely identifies the resource.</li>
              <li>Typical suffixes like "Page" or "Form" help to clearly indicate the usage of the resource by inspection.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that in this example most of the pages are hidden in the folder hierarchy under the <code>WEB-INF</code>
            folder. This is typical of Model 2 web applications where is it highly unusual to visit a view without first going
            through a controller. Placing the JSP files under <code>WEB-INF</code> prevents any direct access via URL.
          </p>

      <div class="section">

        </p>

        <p>
          All commands must implement the {@link org.bibeault.frontman.Command} interface which consists of a single method to be
          called when the Command is to perform its function:
          <pre>
  public void execute( CommandContext commandContext ) throws ServletException, IOException;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>A context object of type {@link org.bibeault.frontman.CommandContext} is passed to this
          method which not only gives the method access to its environment, it provides a bevy of useful methods that the
          Command can take advantage of; methods to easily forward or redirect to other Commands or views via their abstracted names,
          for example.

        <p>
          Front Man gives you three choices regarding how command verbs in the URL are
          mapped to their respective command classes. You can choose whichever means best suits
          your project and programming style, and you can even use all three approaches within
          the same web application.
        </p>

          The three approaches, in order of precedence from highest to lowest are:
          <ol>
            <li>Explicit mappings in a command verbs properties file</li>
            <li>Explicit Java annotations on the command classes</li>

            Within the properties file, each entry associates a command verb with the class name of the
            concrete command class that is to be executed for that verb. Some typical entries in this
            properties file could be:
            <pre>
  doSomethingWonderful=com.whatever.someproject.commands.DoSomethingWonderfulCommand
  login=com.whatever.someproject.commands.LoginCommand
  viewHomePage=com.whatever.someproject.commands.ViewHomePageCommand
  viewLoginPage=com.whatever.someproject.commands.ViewLoginPageCommand
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            Note the naming patterns used for command verbs and for the corresponding command classes. It is highly recommended to
            follow these conventions as it has proved to keep URLs and command code as readable and understandable as possible.
            Notably:
            <ul>
              <li>Command verbs should start with a grammatical verb and a lowercase character. The remainder of the name uses
              typical Java "camel case" and should adhere to the rules for Java identifiers.</li>
              <li>Command class names should be the same as the command verb with the first character upper-cased and the suffix
                "Command" added.</li>
            </ul>
            You are, of course, free to come up with your own conventions, but time and usage has proved that the above simple
            conventions keep things tidy and understandable.
          </p>

          <p>
            These mappings take precedence over Command class annotations and any implied mapping.

          <p>
            For those that don't wish to use external properties files to associate command verbs to Command classes,
            Front Man defines a Java annotation that can be used to directly associate a Command class with a command
            verb directly in the code for the Command class.
          </p>

          <p>
            This annotation is <tt>@FrontmanCommand()</tt> and it takes a single text value that defines the
            command verb to be associated with the Command class.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if we defined a Command class named MyWonderfulCommand, and wished for it to be
            invoked via command verb <tt>doSomethingWonderful</tt>, we would write:
            <pre>
          &#64;FrontmanCommand("doSomethingWonderful")
          public class MyWonderfulCommand implements Command {
            </pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that only classes that implement the {@link org.bibeault.frontman.Command} interface and
            are in the classpath hierarchy identified by the <tt>commandsPath</tt> init parameter will be
            considered for command mappings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Any duplicate mappings between the annotations and those defined in a command
            mapping properties file will resolve to the mapping specified in the properties file.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another means to map command verbs to their respective Command classes is to allow
            Front Man to surmise the name of the command class from the command verb itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this approach, the command class is located relative to the path provided in the <tt>commandsPath</tt>
            init parameter.
          </p>

          <p>
            The full class name for the command is created by concatenating the following values:
            <ul>
              <li>the value of <tt>commandsPath</tt></li>
              <li>a period character</li>
              <li>the command verb with first character uppercased</li>
              <li>the string <tt>Command</tt></li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if the <tt>commandsPath</tt> is defined as <tt>org.something.commands</tt>,
            a command verb of <tt>doSomething</tt> would be mapped to a command class name of
            <tt>org.something.commands.DoSomethingCommand</tt>, while a command verb of <tt>xyz.sayHello</tt>
            would map to <tt>org.something.commands.xyz.SayHelloCommand</tt>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that this implicit mapping is attempted only if no explicit mapping for the command
            verb is found in an explicit property or annotation mapping.

        <a name="SECTION_3_2"><h2>3.2 Command Verb and View Name Name-spacing</h2></a>

        <p>
          In some projects it may make sense to namespace the command verbs in the project.
          This can easily be performed by adding a namespace suffix to the verb or name and using the period
          character as a separator.
        </p>

        <p>
          An example where such segregation is useful might be a web application that requires authentication.
          Most pages in the application require a logged-in user, but obviously some pages and commands, such
          as the login form itself, should not require a logged-in user. Commands and views exempt from authentication
          could belong to one namespace, and commands and views requiring authentication to others.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would then be a simple matter to write a servlet filter that would use the namespace to determine
          if the command being invoked requires authentication or not by looking at the namespace.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are many other situations in which name-spacing your command verbs and view names might be useful.
          It's a handy tip that can make your code and life simpler.
        </p>

        <p>
          When explicitly defining command verb mappings (or view names) within a properties file or via
          Java annotations, it's a simple matter to simply include the namespace as part of the verb; for example:
          <tt>login.viewLoginPage</tt>, <tt>core.subsystem.doSomethingWonderful</tt> or <tt>commerce.ShoppingCartView</tt>.
          In these case, the period characters are not significant and are just part of the mapping key.
        </p>

        <p>
          When using the implicit command mapping by class name approach, however, the period character and the namespace
          names are significant in that they represent the package structure of the command class relative to
          the path defined by the <tt>commandsPath</tt> init parameter. For example, a command verb of
          <tt>core.subsystem.doSomethingWonderful</tt> would implicitly map to a class name of
          <tt>core.subsystem.DoSomethingWonderfulCommand</tt> relative to the package defined by <tt>commandsPath</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>
          View names can use the folder structure for name-spacing using the slash (/) character as a spearator.
          The implicit mapping of such name-spaced views represent the folder structure where the
          corresponding JSP is located. For example, a view name of <tt>core/commerce.details</tt> would implicitly
          map to the file <tt>core/commerce.details.jsp</tt> relative to the folder specified by the
          <tt>viewsPath</tt> init parameter.
